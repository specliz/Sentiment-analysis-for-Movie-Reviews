# Sentiment-analysis-for-Movie-Reviews

## Overview

This project is an exploration of sentiment analysis applied to movie reviews using Python and machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis involves determining whether a given text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. In this case, we are specifically analyzing movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative sentiments.

The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) libraries, such as scikit-learn and Keras to develop and evaluate sentiment analysis models. The primary goal is to showcase expertise in processing and analyzing textual data effectively to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.
